Write a new trace, with one event deleted:
babeltrace <path to existing trace> --component sink.trace-editor.editor --name editor --path <path to new trace> --params delete=<index of event to delete>
babeltrace <path to existing trace> --component sink.trace-editor.editor --name editor --path <path to new trace> --params 'delete="<indexes of events to delete, separated by a comma>"'
babeltrace <path to existing trace> --component sink.trace-editor.editor --name editor --path <path to new trace> --params 'delete-interval="<first index of interval of events to delete>:<last index of interval of events to delete>"'
